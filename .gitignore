# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring
# files. If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text
# editor or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead.
# For example:
#
#     git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#     echo *.swp >> ~/.gitignore_global
#

# Compiled python code.
*.pyc
